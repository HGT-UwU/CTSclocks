Description: CTSclosks is an R package which includes epigenetic clocks that are not 
        confounded by cell-type heterogeneity and that can yield biological age estimates 
        at cell-type resolution. At present, the package can be used to estimate DNAm age
        at cell type level for brain (neuron, gliacyte) and liver (hepatocyte). Besides, the package also 
        provides clocks that allows the estimation of DNAm age at tissue level for brain and liver.
